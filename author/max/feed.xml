&lt;p&gt;2020 has been a devastating year. Covid-19 has killed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/&quot;&gt;nearly two million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, thrown &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2020/10/07/global-action-urgently-needed-to-halt-historic-threats-to-poverty-reduction&quot;&gt;tens of millions&lt;/a&gt; into extreme poverty, and disrupted virtually every aspect of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has also changed perceptions of social protection programs. With millions unable to work safely, populations are more open to unconditional cash transfers, and governments have delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have continued to investigate how societies could adopt universal basic income policies, and fueled by our biggest growth year (we now have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubicenter.org/about&quot;&gt;ten researchers&lt;/a&gt;), we’ve contributed with policy simulations and evidence reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/what-we-learned-about-basic-income-in-2019-48b7db543094&quot;&gt;2019 review&lt;/a&gt;, this post summarizes our work from the past year, along with studies from other researchers and the biggest UBI news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubi-centerresearch&quot;&gt;UBI Center research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-simulation&quot;&gt;Policy simulation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bread-and-butter simulations of UBI policy became more targeted, robust, and policy-relevant throughout 2020. Our simulations showed how UBI would shrink &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-black-white-poverty-and-wealth-gaps-452e2af1497b&quot;&gt;black-white poverty and wealth gaps&lt;/a&gt;, how it would affect &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20200731/ada30.html&quot;&gt;people with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20201012/indigenous.html&quot;&gt;Indigenous Americans&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20201111/veterans.html&quot;&gt;Veterans&lt;/a&gt;, and how a &lt;a href=&quot;http://child-allowance.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;child allowance&lt;/a&gt; would cut child poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-0.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first paper of the Covid era showed how different UBI policy designs could &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBICenter/covid19/master/UBI_for_Covid_19.pdf&quot;&gt;stabilize the poverty rate&lt;/a&gt; amid income-lowering recessions, and our latest analysis showed how replacing our existing tax code with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20201230/us-flat-tax.html&quot;&gt;flat income tax&lt;/a&gt; could be made progressive with a UBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-1.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also compared UBI to other policies (given a fixed budget), finding that it would be more progressive than &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20201117/student-debt.html&quot;&gt;canceling student debt&lt;/a&gt;, and likely more progressive than expanding additional US &lt;a href=&quot;http://covid.ubicenter.org/fpuc&quot;&gt;unemployment benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-research&quot;&gt;Other research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, we expanded our research portfolio beyond policy simulation to other topics related to UBI. We produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20201214/canada-homelessness-experiment.html&quot;&gt;novel analyses&lt;/a&gt; and context of a cash transfer experiment targeting Canadians experiencing homelessness. To inform Democratic primaries, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/basic-income-plans-from-congressional-candidates-mike-broihier-and-suraj-patel-9d53646a3245&quot;&gt;summarized&lt;/a&gt; candidates’ stances on UBI. And we tracked and summarized all 27 emergency cash transfer proposals in the US (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebalance.com/pandemic-tests-universal-basic-income-5078483&quot;&gt;coverage&lt;/a&gt; of our tracker in The Balance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-2.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also integrated deeper non-simulation analysis into simulation projects. Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical&quot;&gt;child allowance project&lt;/a&gt; summarized dozens of papers on the impacts of child poverty, while our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ubicenter.org/20201230/us-flat-tax.html#generous-transfers-are-the-key-to-inequality-reduction&quot;&gt;flat tax project&lt;/a&gt; included original statistical analysis of tax and transfer policies associated with inequality reduction among OECD countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2021-01-01-ubi-centers-2020-year-in-review-3.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;open-source-contributions&quot;&gt;Open source contributions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re the first and only economic policy think tank to open-source all of our work, and we take pride in using and contributing to open source software for economic policy research. This year, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pslmodels.org&quot;&gt;Policy Simulation Library&lt;/a&gt; accepted two of our Python packages — &lt;a href=&quot;http://pslmodels.github.io/openfisca-uk&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;microdf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for analyzing survey data, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pslmodels.github.io/openfisca-uk&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;openfisca-uk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for simulating UK economic policy — to its catalog, adding two of our staff to its leadership council. We also created new incubating models to work with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/scf&quot;&gt;US Survey of Consumer Finances&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/nikhilwoodruff/frs&quot;&gt;UK Family Resources Survey&lt;/a&gt;. Our researchers contributed to several open source projects on GitHub, from improving documentation in PSL’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator/pull/2420&quot;&gt;Tax-Calculator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA/pull/634&quot;&gt;OG-USA&lt;/a&gt; economic models to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mwburke/stargazer/pull/53&quot;&gt;enhancing&lt;/a&gt; Python’s support for producing publication-grade regression tables. Finally, we made our own research more open and reproducible by moving most content to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jupyterbook.org/&quot;&gt;Jupyter-Book&lt;/a&gt;, which shows hideable code within the interactive web document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;outreach&quot;&gt;Outreach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shared our research in numerous forums: op-eds in The Hill on our &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/514672-would-basic-income-be-better-than-additional-unemployment-benefits&quot;&gt;unemployment benefit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/opinion/education/529953-child-allowance-would-boost-gdp&quot;&gt;child allowance&lt;/a&gt; analyses; presentations at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1456wwH-W24gXrfOhvDRCHyqZRhelUx64XTrXj-HQRYw/edit#slide=id.g6293382480_0_338&quot;&gt;Tax Economists Forum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WoHnOqFu6KQ&quot;&gt;PyData Global&lt;/a&gt; conference, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/lL17YLCGSxs&quot;&gt;Social Giving&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/MtDjRauJmE8&quot;&gt;and&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCK_xw0IMDs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/my-nerds-for-humanity-interview-on-basic-income-6f6a13275b44&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;. We also launched our own &lt;a href=&quot;https://us3.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=ffee9994a6979a91e881b8c13&amp;amp;id=938462295c&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and YouTube &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0PhP-7kCHtAjcVc7XfTfA&quot;&gt;channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;plans-for2021&quot;&gt;Plans for 2021&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 promises to be an even bigger year, with upcoming simulations of UBI in the UK, benchmarks of UBI against competing policies, macroeconomic and behavioral effects, interactive tools, events and partnerships, a new website, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;external-research&quot;&gt;External research&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reviews-andtools&quot;&gt;Reviews and tools&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincome.stanford.edu/uploads/Umbrella%20Review%20BI_final.pdf&quot;&gt;Stanford Basic Income Lab UBI study cross-synthesis&lt;/a&gt; affirmed that UBI-type programs alleviate poverty, improve health and education outcomes, while having minimal effects on labour market participation. It nominated understanding of the “tradeoffs between UBI and other programs,” and particularly the impact of “financing a UBI through new revenue streams or diversions from existing programs” as a key gap in the existing research — precisely the gap our research aims to close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cash transfer evidence base also became more navigable with the creation of new tools to access studies that address the impact of cash transfer. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincome.stanford.edu/&quot;&gt;Basic Income Lab&lt;/a&gt; expanded its platform, providing new &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincome.stanford.edu/research/ubi-visualization/&quot;&gt;visualizations&lt;/a&gt; that allow users to dive into studies related to UBIs categorized by outcome. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/cash-research-explorer/&quot;&gt;Cash Research Explorer&lt;/a&gt; that enables users to filter and sort a large database of existing cash transfer studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;policy-simulations&quot;&gt;Policy simulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcomed not being the only UBI simulators in town, with studies on various policy designs being conducted around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, Columbia University’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/&quot;&gt;Center on Poverty &amp;amp; Social Policy&lt;/a&gt; released a series of policy briefs on how a guaranteed income would affect poverty, comparing recent policy proposals and addressing child inclusion in a carbon tax and universal dividend program. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/01/30/how-a-vat-could-tax-the-rich-and-pay-for-universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;simulation from Brookings&lt;/a&gt; found 10% VAT could reduce the debt by $2.9 trillion over 10 years, boost means-tested programs and Social Security, and provide a UBI at 20% of the poverty line, raising bottom-quintile income by 17%. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w27351&quot;&gt;dynamic macro model&lt;/a&gt; found that most Americans would prefer UBI today, but future generations would not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1035304620964272&quot;&gt;Australian study&lt;/a&gt; found that an “affluence-tested” UBI would reduce inequality and poverty to levels similar to Nordic welfare states, requiring an increase in taxation to approximately the OECD average. Other simulations in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41825-017-0007-2&quot;&gt;Gulf states&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://works.bepress.com/widerquist/119/&quot;&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; showed similarly egalitarian results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimal taxation papers continued to study policies that rebate excess revenue as UBI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w28098&quot;&gt;One such paper&lt;/a&gt; found that optimal tax rates and welfare rise when incorporating uncertainty around labor responses, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w27622&quot;&gt;another from NBER&lt;/a&gt; found that “a uniform flat tax on capital and labor income combined with a lump-sum transfer is nearly optimal.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;resilience-and-adherence-covid-19&quot;&gt;Resilience and adherence: COVID-19&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a difficult year in which COVID-19 brought economies around the world to a standstill, we learned more about how cash transfers can create resilience to income shocks. The continuation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt;’s UBI experiment in Kenya during the COVID-19 crisis offered the opportunity to estimate the impact of unconditional cash transfers to poor families. As the first true UBI experiment in history — guaranteeing payments that meet basic needs for each member of randomly selected villages for up to 12 years — its first results deserve special attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/papers/ubi_covid.pdf&quot;&gt;Banerjee et al.&lt;/a&gt; found that the UBI, which began in 2016, significantly reduced recipient hunger, sickness and depression in spite of the pandemic, though with modest effect sizes. It also reduced hospital visits and decreased social interactions, indicating that access to a UBI offered people a greater capacity to follow public health recommendations about social distancing and thereby likely reduced contagion rates. While recipients lost the income gains from starting non-agricultural enterprises during the pandemic, they suffered smaller increases in hunger, indicating that the UBI induced recipients to accept more income risk by mitigating the effects of adverse income shocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;mental-health&quot;&gt;Mental health&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, numerous studies shed light on how cash transfers can reduce stress, improve self-reported well-being and enable participants to make more rational long-term economic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finland’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kela.fi/web/en/news-archive/-/asset_publisher/lN08GY2nIrZo/content/results-of-the-basic-income-experiment-small-employment-effects-better-perceived-economic-security-and-mental-wellbeing&quot;&gt;basic income experiment&lt;/a&gt;, which was carried out in 2017–18, reported this year that basic income recipients were more satisfied with their lives, experienced less mental strain and had a more positive perception of their economic welfare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a developing context, &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/jae/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jae/ejaa010/6015888&quot;&gt;Molotsky and Handa&lt;/a&gt; found that national cash transfers in Malawi reduced stress and improved positive affect among recipients; these psychological effects directly impacted on economic decision-making, encouraging recipients to make more long term decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w28106&quot;&gt;Haushofer et al., 2020b&lt;/a&gt; found that cash transfers in rural Kenya outperformed more costly psychotherapy programs both in economic and psychological well-being outcomes, and that a combination of cash transfers and psychotherapy was no more effective than cash alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304387818310289?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;Haushofer et al., 2020a&lt;/a&gt; found that in Nairobi, free health insurance outperformed a uniform cash transfer of the same value in reducing self-reported stress and cortisol levels, though the most conservative statistical bounds render the difference statistically insignificant. It found no effect of either program on other economic and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large-scale &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/uploads/1/0/9/9/109970865/cash_transfer_meta-analysis_working_paper_1.53.pdf&quot;&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that cash transfers improved self-reported subjective well-being and mental health and that the higher the transfer, the greater the impact. Unconditional cash transfers outperformed conditional cash transfers. And a &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6522/eaay0214?rss%253D1=&quot;&gt;review in Science Magazine&lt;/a&gt; found that “cash transfers and broader antipoverty programs reduce depression and anxiety in randomized trials […] poverty experienced in childhood and in utero [results] in impaired cognitive development and adult mental illness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-effects-of-cash-transfers&quot;&gt;Other effects of cash transfers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voluminous literature on cash transfers continued to grow rapidly in 2020. Here are a sample of influential papers from the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28074/w28074.pdf&quot;&gt;multifaceted intervention&lt;/a&gt; that included a cash transfer for 30 to 40 weeks improved consumption, food security, income, and health for up to a decade. In Mexico, cash transfers &lt;a href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYloKO69ESDXHIU5n-1XmiLK3APrMs0_/view&quot;&gt;halved homicides&lt;/a&gt; on hot days by reducing stress and increasing air conditioning. In Rwanda, cash transfers &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01749&quot;&gt;outperformed&lt;/a&gt; a USAID workforce readiness program on key outcomes like income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, the 1990s retraction of cash assistance to poor mothers &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w28077&quot;&gt;worsened child-parent interactions&lt;/a&gt; (the effect was not traced to changes in the mother’s labor supply). The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w26712&quot;&gt;increased fertility&lt;/a&gt; (births per woman) by 13 percent after its introduction, mostly among women aged 20 to 44.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conditionality-and-targeting&quot;&gt;Conditionality and targeting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X20300024#f0010&quot;&gt;New evidence&lt;/a&gt; from the Kenya Cash Transfer Programme for Orphans and Vulnerable Children for at-risk children shows that enforcing compliance with health conditions with monitoring and fines doesn’t improve program effectiveness compared to ‘labelling’ transfers — providing suggestions for how recipients should use transfers. The study also showed that fines had regressive impacts. Among the poorest transfer recipients, fines for noncompliance were associated with a significant decline in non-food consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers also quantified the cost of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wagner.nyu.edu/impact/research/publications/program-recertification-costs-evidence-snap&quot;&gt;administrative burdens&lt;/a&gt; for SNAP recipients in the US, and the New York Times centered this research in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/28/upshot/administrative-burden-quiz.html&quot;&gt;interactive story&lt;/a&gt;. The Jain Family Institute published two papers in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/projects/from-idea-to-reality-the-future-of-guaranteed-income/&quot;&gt;series on guaranteed income&lt;/a&gt;, describing implementation of guaranteed income in the US and a framework for considering what programs the guaranteed income could suitably replace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;polls&quot;&gt;Polls&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pollsters asked people from all over the world how they felt about UBI and cash transfers, and the timing of these polls showed how Covid-19 affected sentiments toward the welfare state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first polls came from the US, where &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheUBICenter/status/1245575691082428423&quot;&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, 63% of people aged 18–36 supported a universal basic income of $1,000 per month for adults. Data for Progress &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/3/19/voters-want-the-government-to-send-everyone-1000&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that net support for sending each American a check for $1,000 rose from -15 to +32 between March 2 and March 17, when the gravity of the pandemic became apparent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/3/21/voters-support-a-robust-cash-payment&quot;&gt;Also in March&lt;/a&gt;, Data for Progress found that Americans prefer ongoing payments to one-time payments by a 38-point margin, and between monthly payments of (a) $2,000/adult + $1,000/child and (b) $1,000/adult, voters prefer the larger amount by a 15-point margin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polls outside the US found majority support for the policy, too. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://eupinions.eu/de/text/in-crisis-europeans-support-radical-positions&quot;&gt;March poll&lt;/a&gt; found that 71% of Europeans support UBI; an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/5y7qpjzd6v/NEON_CoronavirusClimate_200417_W.pdf&quot;&gt;April poll&lt;/a&gt; found that 51% of Brits supported it; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.probe-research.com/polls/manitobans-support-universal-basic-income-higher-taxes-high-income-earners-and-larger&quot;&gt;also in April&lt;/a&gt;, 62% of Manitoba, Canada residents supported UBI; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-11/survey-says-most-australians-welcome-universal-basic-income/12970924&quot;&gt;as of October&lt;/a&gt;, 58% of Australians supported it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;news&quot;&gt;News&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;calls-forubi&quot;&gt;Calls for UBI&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government leaders and other influential people and organizations called for UBI pilots and policies, especially relating to (but not limited to) the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most forceful voices came from the UK. The Liberal Democrats (the third largest party, which received &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_breakdown_of_the_2019_United_Kingdom_general_election&quot;&gt;12 percent of votes&lt;/a&gt; in 2019) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.libdems.org.uk/a20-ubi&quot;&gt;endorsed UBI&lt;/a&gt; in September, and in October, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubilabnetwork.org/letter-to-rishi-sunak&quot;&gt;over 500 MPs, peers and councillors&lt;/a&gt; requested that the Chancellor support UBI trials. Throughout the year, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/31/covid-job-losses-lead-mps-to-call-for-trials-of-universal-basic-income&quot;&gt;several councils&lt;/a&gt; campaigned to launch UBI pilots in their areas, including Liverpool, Brighton, Leeds, Norwich and Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in Canada have been similarly enthusiastic. Canada has a rich history of unconditional cash transfers: they created the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200624-canadas-forgotten-universal-basic-income-experiment&quot;&gt;Mincome experiment&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, a UBI pilot in the province of Ontario (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/ontario-is-canceling-its-basic-income-experiment&quot;&gt;prematurely cancelled&lt;/a&gt; in 2019), a generous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ubiworks.ca/ccb&quot;&gt;child benefit&lt;/a&gt;, and the CERB program providing CAD 2,000 (USD 1,570) per month through September to people who’d lost employment due to Covid-19. In July, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/now-is-the-time-to-bring-a-basic-income-program-to-canada-says-b-c-senator-but-the-pilot-project-could-cost-100-million&quot;&gt;British Columbia Senator Yuen Pau&lt;/a&gt; Woo suggested testing UBI, and in the same month, the Senate national finance committee released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://sencanada.ca/en/info-page/parl-43-1/nffn-covid-19-relief-in-times-of-crisis/&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the need for UBI. In September, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/09/15/coalition-calls-on-federal-liberals-to-bring-in-a-basic-income-to-address-gender-inequity.html&quot;&gt;a coalition&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 4,000 individuals and organizations called on the federal government to work toward UBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, several members of Congress called for one-time and recurring unconditional payments amid Covid-19 (see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://covid19tracker.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt;), including a proposal for $2,000 monthly checks per person from Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The one-time relief payments of $1,200 from March were renewed at $600 in the December bill, along with flat payments of $300 per week for unemployed people (down from $600 from April through July). The governor of Alaska also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/12/14/dunleavy-proposes-nearly-5000-in-dividends-for-alaskans-cuts-other-state-spending/&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; increasing the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend from its normal value of $1,000-$3,000 to $5,000 due to the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro-UBI US voices were elevated in 2021, too. In April, Jack Dorsey created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/7/21212757/coronavirus-jack-dorsey-charity-billion-llc&quot;&gt;$1 billion philanthropic fund&lt;/a&gt; from his holdings in Square; the fund has since grown to $3.7 billion, of which he’s spent $330 million, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uT6Tw0lrYMj9YSQpkMAyf_i31Urf0IWW5wIJ76Rckv8/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;$44 million&lt;/a&gt; for UBI pilots. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1286675223434141697&quot;&gt;Pro-UBI&lt;/a&gt; Elon Musk became the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/12/08/elon-musk-passes-bernard-arnault-to-become-the-worlds-second-richest-person/?sh=ab0da895cb0d&quot;&gt;second wealthiest person&lt;/a&gt; in December. Andrew Yang, who centered his presidential campaign on UBI (we &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/a-revenue-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d7d517dbeeea&quot;&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/why-some-low-income-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-c95d0f1cc433&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://plans.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;calculator&lt;/a&gt; on his plan in 2019), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/11/politics/andrew-yang-ends-2020-presidential-campaign/index.html&quot;&gt;ended his presidential campaign&lt;/a&gt; in February, but he is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/531337-poll-finds-andrew-yang-favored-for-new-york-city-mayor&quot;&gt;now the favorite&lt;/a&gt; for New York City’s 2021 mayoral race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaders in various other countries have supported UBI as well. In March, one of Australia’s largest unions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8154513/Australian-union-pushes-universal-income-740-week.html&quot;&gt;called for a guaranteed income&lt;/a&gt; throughout the pandemic, structured as a job guarantee plus AUD 740 (USD 725) per week for people who don’t participate in the job guarantee program. In South Africa, the governing party &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.groundup.org.za/media/uploads/documents/anc_nec_stsc_big-1.pdf&quot;&gt;highlighted&lt;/a&gt; the need for a UBI, but plans for a 2020 policy were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-economy-universalincomegrant/south-africa-will-not-have-universal-basic-income-grant-this-year-minister-says-idUSKCN24W2WK&quot;&gt;scrapped in July&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the United Nations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cepal.org/en/publications/45544-social-challenge-times-covid-19&quot;&gt;Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; and UN Development Program’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/05/1063312&quot;&gt;Asia-Pacific bureau&lt;/a&gt; have called for UBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;guaranteed-income-initiatives&quot;&gt;Guaranteed income initiatives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to one-time payments and ongoing payments to unemployed people like those in the US and Canada, several governments and nonprofits are sending regular cash payments to broad sets of people without requiring work history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mayorsforagi.org/&quot;&gt;Mayors for a Guaranteed Income&lt;/a&gt; — which now includes over 30 mayors — is driving a number of new philanthropically-funded guaranteed income pilots, including in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-18/800-compton-residents-to-get&quot;&gt;Compton&lt;/a&gt;, and established the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sp2.upenn.edu/center-for-guaranteed-income-research-recently-launched/&quot;&gt;Center for Guaranteed Income Research&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;a href=&quot;https://reason.com/2020/10/13/san-francisco-will-pay-artists-1000-a-month-in-universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://basicincometoday.com/long-beach-moves-ahead-with-guaranteed-basic-income-for-some-artists/&quot;&gt;Long Beach&lt;/a&gt; will also both give basic incomes to artists (see our comments in coverage of the San Francisco program). But the nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/us/&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; has already distributed the most — since March, they’ve transferred $1,000 to each of 134,000 SNAP recipients, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GiveDirectly-End-of-Year-Update.pdf?utm_source=email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=202012eoyupdatematch&amp;amp;utm_content=eoy_update&quot;&gt;99% efficiency&lt;/a&gt; and an average of two days between enrollment and first payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GiveDirectly also delivered transfers to over 500,000 recipients outside the US, creating new contact-free payment models and adding new programs. For example, they provided USAID-funded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.liberianobserver.com/news/givedirectly-educational-stipends-for-12th-graders-writing-the-wassce-exam/&quot;&gt;educational stipends&lt;/a&gt; of $50 to 37,000 12th-graders in every high school in Liberia, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90585079/how-givedirectly-is-finding-the-poorest-people-in-the-world-and-sending-them-cash&quot;&gt;applied machine learning&lt;/a&gt; to identify and pay extremely poor households in Togo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economics/brazils-government-backs-new-basic-income-payments-to-poor-idUKKBN26J381&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; its Bolsa Familia cash transfer into a new program called Renda Cidada (“citizen income”), and Bogota, Colombia, is giving cash and food aid to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2020/11/17/claudia-lopez-on-the-acceleration-of-social-innovation&quot;&gt;over 700,000 households&lt;/a&gt;. Spain introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2020/5/30/spain-introduces-basic-income-scheme-to-tackle-poverty&quot;&gt;minimum income program&lt;/a&gt; that intended to benefit over 2 million individuals, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barrons.com/news/spain-struggles-to-put-in-place-basic-income-scheme-01598763004&quot;&gt;implementation challenges&lt;/a&gt; are slowing it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On most measures, 2021 has a low bar to clear to outdo 2020. Given this array of studies, UBI research might not be one of those measures, but we expect even more simulations, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and new programs to inform UBI policy design and how UBI compares to the status quo and alternatives.

      <content type="html" xml:base="/basic-income-plans-from-congressional-candidates-mike-broihier-and-suraj-patel">&lt;h4 id=&quot;broihier-and-patel-are-running-in-democratic-primaries-today&quot;&gt;Broihier and Patel are running in Democratic primaries today&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the Democrats in &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/todays-elections-in-kentucky-and-new-york-are-high-stakes-for-the-progressive-movement/&quot;&gt;six states&lt;/a&gt; voting in primaries or primary run-offs today, some will see basic-income-friendly candidates on their ballot. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikeforky.com/&quot;&gt;Mike Broihier&lt;/a&gt; is one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Kentucky,_2020&quot;&gt;ten candidates&lt;/a&gt; running for the chance to battle Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surajpatel.nyc/&quot;&gt;Suraj Patel&lt;/a&gt; is one of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ballotpedia.org/New_York%27s_12th_Congressional_District&quot;&gt;three challengers&lt;/a&gt; to incumbent Carolyn Maloney in New York’s 12th congressional district (a blue district in New York City).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broihier is a farmer and former Marine who’s earned the endorsement of former presidential candidate Andrew Yang by making UBI the centerpiece of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://mikeforky.com/issues/&quot;&gt;economic plan&lt;/a&gt;. Patel is an attorney and business ethics lecturer who has called for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surajpatel.nyc/new-page&quot;&gt;child allowance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@surajpatelnyc/fiscal-response-to-covid-19-6a4384e5e89f&quot;&gt;emergency UBI&lt;/a&gt; throughout the Covid-19 economic crisis. Here’s more on their basic income plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;both-support-emergency-ubi&quot;&gt;Both support emergency UBI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broihier and Patel join many prominent economists in calling for emergency relief payments for each person, for each month of the crisis. By avoiding means-testing, these payments could be delivered more quickly and without excluding people whose income has changed in the past couple of years (the duration the means-tested Recovery Rebates considered for determining eligibility). Both also support giving some to children as well as adults, which my research found is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid-19-9950e4a58030&quot;&gt;more cost-effective way&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broihier &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiBlfBFx7UBdgORWqRgKUt8r6EDzVc8LcqB8-072aJU/edit&quot;&gt;proposes&lt;/a&gt; $2,000 per adult and $1,000 per child, “each and every month until this crisis has ended and the economy has been revved back up out of recession.” The US has &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=population%20by%20age&amp;amp;hidePreview=false&amp;amp;tid=ACSST1Y2018.S0101&amp;amp;t=Age%20and%20Sex&amp;amp;vintage=2018&quot;&gt;73 million children and 254 million adults&lt;/a&gt;, so this plan would cost $580 billion per month, or about a third of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@surajpatelnyc/fiscal-response-to-covid-19-6a4384e5e89f&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; is half that of Broihier’s: $1,000 per adult and $500 per child, “until the pandemic is contained and the Sahm Rule is no longer triggered.” The Sahm Rule, named after economist Claudia Sahm (who also supports direct payments), identifies recessions as periods when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate is 0.5 percentage points above its low from the prior 12 months. This would cost $290 billion per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As captured in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://covid19tracker.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;Covid-19 tracker&lt;/a&gt;, several other members of Congress support cash payments to relieve economic stresses from our historic recession, and some have introduced legislation to provide them. Some of these proposals have been universal and not monthly, such as Senator Mitt Romney’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-calls-urgent-action-additional-coronavirus-response-measures&quot;&gt;call&lt;/a&gt; for one-time $1,000 payments to each adult. Others have been monthly but not universal, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.politico.com/ea/52/4e9d51534400b64f3a5fa40aabfd/gai20332-4.pdf&quot;&gt;Monthly Economic Crisis and Support Act&lt;/a&gt; from Senators Harris, Sanders, and Markey, which provides payments of $2,000 per person per month, phasing out for high-income households. However, universal monthly payments have been proposed by Senator &lt;a href=&quot;https://berniesanders.com/issues/emergency-response-coronavirus-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt; and Representatives &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1242486422180855815&quot;&gt;Justin Amash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6553&quot;&gt;Rashida Tlaib&lt;/a&gt; (and 11 cosponsors), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6290/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded&quot;&gt;Ilhan Omar&lt;/a&gt; (and 4 cosponsors), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/897&quot;&gt;Tulsi Gabbard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;broihiers-ambitious-ubi-is-part-of-wide-ranging-fiscalreform&quot;&gt;Broihier’s ambitious UBI is part of wide-ranging fiscal reform&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Covid-19 crisis ends, Broihier &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kiBlfBFx7UBdgORWqRgKUt8r6EDzVc8LcqB8-072aJU/edit&quot;&gt;proposes&lt;/a&gt; transitioning the emergency UBI into a smaller permanent one: monthly payments of $1,200 per adult and $400 per child. This targets bringing everyone above the official poverty measure, with a buffer to pay new taxes funding the UBI. It would cost $330 billion per month — $4 trillion per year, or about a fifth of GDP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-06-23-basic-income-plans-from-congressional-candidates-mike-broihier-and-suraj-patel-1.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary funding sources would be a 10 percent value added tax (VAT) and the elimination of all tax deductions and credits, including the standard deduction. A 10 percent VAT would raise about &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxfoundation.org/andrew-yang-value-added-tax-universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;$1 trillion per year&lt;/a&gt;, and Broihier estimates that eliminating all deductions and credits would raise about $1.5 trillion per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the cost would also be offset by counting the UBI as income against means-tested benefit eligibility, and eliminating Temporary Aid for Needy Families (which now only gives about &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-welfare-dollars-dont-go-directly-to-poor-people-anymore/&quot;&gt;a quarter of its funds&lt;/a&gt; as cash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce the deficit impact over time, Broihier proposes taxing public US companies based on their market capitalization: 3 percent upon IPO, merger, or acquisition, and another 0.5 percent per year. The tax would be paid in stock rather than cash, creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/projects/social-wealth-fund&quot;&gt;social wealth fund&lt;/a&gt; that bears interest for future public spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Broihier proposes eliminating the income cap on payroll taxes, while also lowering rates from 6.2 percent to 4 percent on both employers and employees. Social Security benefits would not change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of the $1,200/$400 UBI, Broihier would institute a carbon fee-and-dividend, where each metric ton of carbon emissions is priced at $40 — rising $15 per year — and the proceeds are shared equally with Americans. As he notes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.econstatement.org/&quot;&gt;over 3,300 economists&lt;/a&gt; support the carbon fee-and-dividend model as an effective and equitable climate change tool, including many who have held top government positions. There are also a number of carbon fee-and-dividend bills in Congress, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://energyinnovationact.org/&quot;&gt;Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act&lt;/a&gt;, which has 81 co-sponsors and a similar structure to Broihier’s plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;patels-generous-child-allowance&quot;&gt;Patel’s generous child allowance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-06-23-basic-income-plans-from-congressional-candidates-mike-broihier-and-suraj-patel-2.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surajpatel.nyc/new-page&quot;&gt;Family Opportunity Guarantee&lt;/a&gt;, Suraj Patel proposes replacing the Child Tax Credit (CTC) with “a Universal Child Dividend of $500 per kid, per month ages 0–5; $350 per kid, per month ages 6–17.” The Universal Child Dividend would cost about $360 billion per year, or $240 billion after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pgpf.org/budget-basics/what-is-the-child-tax-credit&quot;&gt;replacing the CTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patel appears to have modeled this after the American Family Act (AFA), Senator Michael Bennet’s plan to make the CTC fully available to low-income families, increase the amount (with a bonus for young children), and distribute it monthly rather than annually. Specifically, it makes the credit “fully refundable,” meaning the entirety of it is provided to families that don’t owe net federal taxes. As I &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@MaxGhenis/we-should-replace-the-child-tax-credit-with-a-universal-child-benefit-33773de07271&quot;&gt;wrote in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, even a budget-neutral replacement of the Child Tax Credit with a child allowance would cut child poverty by 15 percent, since the CTC’s non-refundable component excludes our poorest kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AFA would boost the up-to-$2,000 CTC to $3,000 per child aged 6 to 16 and $3,600 per child under 6. It’s been estimated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2019/3/5/the-afa-and-child-poverty&quot;&gt;cut child poverty by 42 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and is co-sponsored by most Democrats in both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/690/related-bills&quot;&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1560&quot;&gt;House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Patel claims, “The Universal Child Dividend alone will slash child poverty in half,” which seems like a conservative estimate given the payments would be about 50 percent larger than the AFA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;these-plans-would-be-progressive&quot;&gt;These plans would be progressive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lieu of a full distributional analysis, we can learn from other analyses of similar plans. For example, my analysis of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend found that it would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;highly progressive&lt;/a&gt;, despite the slightly regressive VAT structure and reduction of benefit outlays. Other analyses have found that child allowances &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/5c7fe48b1905f46e1214bc42/1551885452114/Poverty+%26+Social+Policy+Brief+3_3.pdf&quot;&gt;cut poverty substantially&lt;/a&gt; — even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2018/11/29/a-child-allowance-would-be-very-effective-at-poverty-reduction/&quot;&gt;more than adult UBIs&lt;/a&gt; per dollar spent. Broihier’s addition of a child allowance to Yang’s adult-only proposal, and Patel’s Universal Child Dividend, are both effective antipoverty policies that would also invest in our future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-blackwhite-poverty-and-wealth-gaps">&lt;p&gt;Today, one in five black Americans lives in poverty, nearly double the rate of white Americans. Meanwhile, the average net worth of white families is more than five times that of black families, and the median is more than seven times higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These gaps are the product of slavery, Jim Crow laws, housing laws denying black Americans federal mortgage subsidies, and many more injustices. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/15/us/racist-deeds-covenants/index.html&quot;&gt;whites-only covenants&lt;/a&gt; in housing deeds across America, we have yet to erase the economic legacies of our racist history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of economic policies have been proposed to reduce these gaps, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/5c4339f67ba7fc4a9add58f9/1547909624486/Zewde-Baby-Bonds-WP-10-30-18.pdf&quot;&gt;“baby bonds”&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/working-families-tax-relief-act-would-raise-incomes-of-46-million-households&quot;&gt;expansions of refundable tax credits&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/06/15/black-reparations-and-the-racial-wealth-gap/&quot;&gt;reparations&lt;/a&gt;. How would universal basic income fare?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I went to the Census Bureau’s 2018 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/supplemental-poverty-measure.html&quot;&gt;Supplemental Poverty Measure&lt;/a&gt; (SPM; see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2015/9/16/9337041/supplemental-poverty-measure&quot;&gt;Vox explainer&lt;/a&gt; on SPM’s improvements over the Official Poverty Measure) and the Federal Reserve’s 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm&quot;&gt;Survey of Consumer Finances&lt;/a&gt;. I modeled how the black-white gaps&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:gaps&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:gaps&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the SPM poverty rate, median wealth, and mean wealth change when providing each person (children, too) an unconditional payment each month. I don’t assume any funding, so this can be thought of as a lower bound on the gap closure, if the UBI were to be funded through progressive taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results show large effects from even modest UBIs. For example, a $200 per month payment would more than halve the black poverty rate, putting it below the current white poverty rate. This would cost about $800 billion per year. A $1,000 monthly UBI would reduce the poverty rate from its current 13 percent to roughly 1 percent for all racial groups, costing about $4 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-06-20-how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-blackwhite-poverty-and-wealth-gaps-0.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBI wouldn’t only reduce the black poverty rate on an absolute basis, it would also close the black-white poverty gap. Currently, the black poverty rate is 1.82 times the white poverty rate; a $200-per-month UBI would reduce that to 1.65, and a $1,000-per-month UBI would reduce it to 1.38.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-06-20-how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-blackwhite-poverty-and-wealth-gaps-1.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of racial wealth inequality — hundreds of years in the making — dampens the effect compared to poverty. White families have median wealth of $125,000, 7.7 times the median black wealth of $16,300. The mean wealth delta is relatively smaller but larger on an absolute basis: white families have average wealth of $800,000, 5.7 times the $140,000 mean wealth of black families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again there are significant effects from even the $200-per-month UBI, which would cut the median wealth gap from 7.7 to 6.0 and cut the mean wealth gap from 5.7 to 5.5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-06-20-how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-blackwhite-poverty-and-wealth-gaps-2.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this assumes people save their entire UBI, it only reflects the program’s first year. Given how income inequality &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-21/how-income-inequality-feeds-the-racial-wealth-gap&quot;&gt;contributes to&lt;/a&gt; wealth inequality, we can expect that the policy would shrink the racial wealth gap more in later years, as families accrue, invest, and bequeath parts of their ongoing UBI payments over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together and benchmarking against today, the black-white poverty and wealth gaps shrink more as the UBI grows. A $200-per-month UBI would reduce the mean wealth gap by 3.6 percent, the poverty gap by 21 percent, and the median wealth gap by 25 percent. $1,000 per month would cut the mean wealth gap by 16 percent, the poverty gap by 53 percent, and the median wealth gap by 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-06-20-how-universal-basic-income-would-affect-the-blackwhite-poverty-and-wealth-gaps-3.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The severity of economic disparities between black and white families justifies considering a wide range of solutions. By avoiding exclusions or strings, UBI reaches everyone and cuts the gaps substantially. Let’s include it in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:gaps&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;White includes Hispanic. White and black mean white only and black only.

      <id>/my-nerds-for-humanity-interview-on-basic-income</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/my-nerds-for-humanity-interview-on-basic-income">&lt;h4 id=&quot;watch-ithere&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/DCUq5_ERDp8&quot;&gt;Watch it here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I joined Tom from &lt;a href=&quot;http://nerdsforhumanity.com&quot;&gt;Nerds for Humanity&lt;/a&gt; for a live-streamed interview. The Nerds for Humanity channel (formerly Nerds for Yang) runs multiple streams weekly on topics surrounding Andrew Yang, universal basic income, and global affairs more broadly. As you might guess from the name, Tom emphasizes data in his videos, frequently incorporating charts and graphs, so our research-oriented conversation was thought-provoking and wide-ranging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After starting with my background and path to the UBI Center, we went through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1__9a9c8567HDQ4BltigfYCFsEb56jhzIL5GBOzI9uNA/edit&quot;&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt; with research from myself and others on UBI. This covered four sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poverty, inequality, and progressivity.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite strong economic growth from 2009–2018, the US poverty rate fell less than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-268.pdf&quot;&gt;15 percent&lt;/a&gt;. And despite having the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/04/05/americas-taxes-are-the-most-progressive-in-the-world-its-government-is-among-the-least/&quot;&gt;most progressive tax code&lt;/a&gt; of OECD countries, US redistribution doesn’t reduce inequality as much as our peers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-united-states.pdf&quot;&gt;Low overall tax levels&lt;/a&gt; and resulting meager, means-tested benefits could explain both of these shortcomings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current programs.&lt;/strong&gt;US safety net programs create &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;perverse incentives&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbpp.org/research/romneys-charge-that-most-federal-low-income-spending-goes-for-overhead-and-bureaucrats-is&quot;&gt;costly to administer&lt;/a&gt; (and comply with). Moving to UBI addresses these issues, and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@MaxGhenis/we-should-replace-the-child-tax-credit-with-a-universal-child-benefit-33773de07271&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found that replacing the Child Tax Credit with a child allowance (UBI for kids) would reduce child poverty and inequality, even without adding cost to the government.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic income.&lt;/strong&gt;My analysis of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend found that it would dramatically &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;reduce poverty and inequality&lt;/a&gt;, even if shrunk down to a budget-neutral level near &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/a-revenue-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d7d517dbeeea&quot;&gt;$500 per month&lt;/a&gt;. The UBI Center &lt;a href=&quot;http://plans.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;Plan Explorer&lt;/a&gt; shows how different types of households would be affected after taxes and benefit reductions. By applying machine learning tools to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cZwBc3dvv5ZXTMArKmwJOuyZeo3VJkMtIhKP_6qHZw0/edit#slide=id.g599c28a6b3_0_147&quot;&gt;optimize UBI policy design&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the outcome you care about — for example, reducing poverty, inequality, or disruption — can significantly affect policy parameters like the amount given to kids vs. adults.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Covid-19.&lt;/strong&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid-19-9950e4a58030&quot;&gt;latest full paper&lt;/a&gt; considers how UBI should be structured to stabilize the poverty rate as Covid-19 lowers incomes, finding smaller amounts given to a broader recipient base to be more cost-effective than limiting recipiency. In two other works in progress, I find that (a) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UBICenter/hanna_olken/blob/master/tex/main.pdf&quot;&gt;greater uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; about recipients’ financial situation (as is the case today, given income may differ substantially from past tax returns used for targeting) make broader transfers such as UBI more desirable, and (b) the new $600 per week unemployment benefit &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/UBICenter/covid19/blob/master/adhoc/ui_ubi.ipynb&quot;&gt;reduces poverty less&lt;/a&gt; than a budget-neutral UBI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the nearly-two-hour interview, we interspersed topics ranging from political economy to technological unemployment to macroeconomic modeling, often spurred by viewers’ live comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>/tracking-us-emergency-cash-transfer-proposals</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/tracking-us-emergency-cash-transfer-proposals">&lt;h4 id=&quot;see-the-tracker-here-and-ubicenterorgcovid19-for-moreresearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZuHR2uOKWoloXw5raJzMNRjOMggcWdBxYB3Jhf0B4lE&quot;&gt;See the tracker here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ubicenter.org/covid19&quot;&gt;ubicenter.org/covid19&lt;/a&gt; for more research&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 outbreak is preventing workers from collecting a paycheck, blowing up unemployment rolls, sending capital income into the red, and devastating job-seekers. To ensure families can keep paying their bills, United States policymakers are increasingly considering emergency cash transfers and universal basic income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first proposals arrived on March 12, when Democratic Representatives &lt;a href=&quot;https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-reps-ryan-khanna-propose-cash-infusion-between-1000-6000-help-working&quot;&gt;Ro Khanna, Tim Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/897&quot;&gt;Tulsi Gabbard&lt;/a&gt; proposed different forms of monthly payments of $1,000 per adult. The most recent is the House Democrats’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20200511/BILLS-116hr6800ih.pdf&quot;&gt;HEROES Act&lt;/a&gt;, which gives one-time payments of $1,200 per person, phasing out for incomes above $75,000 ($150,000 for married filers). Democrats and Republicans in the House, Senate, and White House have proposed 20 total cash transfer and UBI policies, including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000171-0319-d8a3-a3f5-73bfe5b20000&quot;&gt;CARES Act&lt;/a&gt;, signed on March 27, which provides one-time payments up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, depending on 2019 income (or 2018 if you haven’t filed yet for 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight of the 20 proposals — from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/897&quot;&gt;Gabbard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-calls-urgent-action-additional-coronavirus-response-measures&quot;&gt;Mitt Romney&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://berniesanders.com/issues/emergency-response-coronavirus-pandemic/&quot;&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1239946523456286722&quot;&gt;Ilhan Omar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepJoeKennedy/status/1239920721792565250&quot;&gt;Joe Kennedy III&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fsc_covid-19_legislative_package_-_03.18.20.pdf&quot;&gt;Maxine Waters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tlaib.house.gov/sites/tlaib.house.gov/files/Automatic%20Boost%20to%20Communities%20Act%20.pdf&quot;&gt;Rashida Tlaib&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1242486422180855815&quot;&gt;Justin Amash&lt;/a&gt; — resemble UBI in that they are given to everyone regardless of income.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:kennedy&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:kennedy&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By skipping reliance on 2018 or 2019 IRS tax return data, UBI can be distributed quickly without excluding people whose financial situation has changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These emergency cash transfer proposals vary by amount, inclusion of children, whether they phase out with income, frequency, and other factors. To keep track of them all, I made &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZuHR2uOKWoloXw5raJzMNRjOMggcWdBxYB3Jhf0B4lE&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this spreadsheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which breaks each proposal down by 17 features (snapshot below). I’ll continue to update it as discussions in Washington evolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Covid-19 coronavirus batters the global economy, United States policymakers are considering a range of responses to keep families afloat. In addition to targeted policies like payroll tax cuts, paid sick leave, and small business loans, a simple approach is gaining traction: sending checks directly to families.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2020/03/thoughts-on-pandemic.html?m=1&quot;&gt;economists&lt;/a&gt; in calling for immediate cash transfers to ensure all Americans can meet basic needs in these dire times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many are gravitating specifically to universal basic income (UBI), which would provide the same amount to everyone. This is attractive today because restricting based on income would involve looking to tax returns for the year 2018, which might not represent families’ current finances, or 2019, many of which have not yet been filed. Relying on the IRS could also delay the delivery of this badly-needed money and require special treatment for nonfilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we choose UBI, how large should it be? And who should be included?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, I focused on a simple objective: &lt;strong&gt;stopping the poverty rate from rising,&lt;/strong&gt; as it did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/historical-spm-data-reg&quot;&gt;in the Great Recession&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody knows how much Covid-19 will shrink incomes throughout 2020, so I simulated a range of decreases from 1 to 20 percent. For each scenario, I calculated the UBI necessary to stabilize the poverty rate, depending on who is included, from everyone to only adult citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results, which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBICenter/covid19/master/UBI_for_Covid_19.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in my new paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reveal that a modest UBI can stabilize poverty — if we include everyone. For example, a $1,000 annual UBI would more than offset a 10 percent fall in incomes — &lt;a href=&quot;https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qrBT&quot;&gt;roughly the drop from 2007 to 2011&lt;/a&gt;. If we exclude children and noncitizens, however, many would continue to slip into poverty, and the checks would have to exceed $1,500 per recipient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-03-20-how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid19-0.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The higher amount required swamps the savings from sending fewer checks. Giving to everyone means sending 42 percent more checks, but excluding children and noncitizens requires each check to be 83 percent larger to stop the poverty rate from rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a net basis, stabilizing poverty is 23 percent cheaper with a UBI that includes everyone, compared to one that’s limited to adult citizens. Including everyone is also cheaper than all other eligibility options I modeled, such as including all adults but only giving a half share to children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-03-20-how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid19-1.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These results also hold regardless of how low incomes fall; inclusive UBIs are consistently more cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-03-20-how-universal-basic-income-can-keep-poverty-from-rising-amid-covid19-2.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many questions remain: For example, how do these results change if we learn that service workers are disproportionately harmed? How much of the gap could safety net programs fill, especially if they’re expanded? How do UBIs compare to alternative policies on a per-dollar basis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poverty stabilization is also far from the only outcome to consider. Paid sick leave might help to contain the infection; payroll tax cuts might keep people employed; small business loans might keep doors from shutting. But each of these is likely to be regressive compared to UBI, and to have a smaller anti-poverty effect. Keeping poverty from rising should be a high priority, but it shouldn’t be the only distributional goal when designing pandemic relief programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBI is well positioned to help all people with the urgency required of this crisis. Cash can be distributed immediately, especially if it’s done broadly. Unlike in-kind benefits like food stamps, it can be used to pay any bills that arise. And as my new paper shows, UBI is a cost-effective tool to prevent a rise in poverty. To maximize the anti-poverty impact, we should send checks broadly, generously, and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;2019 has been a big year for universal basic income (UBI). Web searches for the topic rose over 40 percent since 2018 in the US, and over 130 percent globally. A 2019 Nobel laureate wrote a paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://economics.mit.edu/files/16000&quot;&gt;UBI in the developing world&lt;/a&gt;, the World Bank published a book of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/00XEDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=0&quot;&gt;UBI evidence&lt;/a&gt;, and Palgrave Macmillan published the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030143770&quot;&gt;fifteenth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030236137&quot;&gt;sixteenth&lt;/a&gt; books in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palgrave.com/gp/series/14981&quot;&gt;academic series on UBI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-01-01-what-we-learned-about-basic-income-in-2019-0.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post reviews a slice of the UBI-related research that came out this year. It begins with evaluations of UBI programs and experiments, then considers simulations of UBI policy, followed by studies of related programs like cash transfers, and finally how the public feels about UBI and cash transfers (and what affects those sentiments).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ubi-programs&quot;&gt;UBI programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of new studies came out on the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which pays residents between $1,000 and $3,000 per year from returns on oil wealth. Guettabi’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11122/10581/2019_05_20-EffectsOfAKPFD.pdf?sequence=1&quot;&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of research to date summarizes the null effect on employment, positive effects on birthweight and consumption of non-durable goods (e.g. food, not cars) and services, and reductions of childhood obesity and poverty; the review also showed increased income inequality. Feinberg and Keuhn found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IIOC2019&amp;amp;paper_id=40&quot;&gt;entrepreneurship rose&lt;/a&gt; after the PFD’s introduction, though the effect faded. The PFD increased &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.iseralaska.org/media/7c5b42d2-02b3-46dc-8221-5d32776ec51f/Universal_Cash_and_Crime.pdf&quot;&gt;substance abuse&lt;/a&gt; incidents, had no effect on violent crime, and reduced property crime (Watson et al; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.westminster.ac.uk/sites/default/public-files/general-documents/WPS%202019_02_Dorsett%20R.pdf&quot;&gt;Dorsett&lt;/a&gt; also found reduced property crime, but only when the PFD payouts were large). Lerner found no detectable effect of the PFD on &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04083.pdf&quot;&gt;high school completion&lt;/a&gt;. Mahdavi goes back to the PFD’s introduction in 1976, finding that receiving the PFD just before an election &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paashamahdavi.com/LBP-aug2019.pdf&quot;&gt;reduces voter turnout&lt;/a&gt; compared to receiving it just afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/161361/Report_The%20Basic%20Income%20Experiment%2020172018%20in%20Finland.pdf&quot;&gt;Finland’s UBI experiment&lt;/a&gt; had no effect on employment, but significantly improved each of 14 questions asked about well-being, from trust to confidence to health, and raised appetite for UBI. The Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED) launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://seed.sworps.tennessee.edu/employment.html&quot;&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; characterizing the recipients and comparison groups, but no experiment results yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simulations&quot;&gt;Simulations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoynes and Rothstein &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nber.org/papers/w25538&quot;&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; in February that “UBI pilot studies will do little to resolve the major outstanding questions,” and that design questions — for example, how it’s funded and what it replaces — deserve more attention. Researchers started to answer that call throughout the year, simulating full UBIs, UBIs for children, and smaller UBIs funded by fees on carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ubi-simulations&quot;&gt;UBI simulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple researchers, myself included, simulated presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend, a UBI of $1,000 per month per adult funded by a 10 percent VAT and other sources. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that a 10 percent VAT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crfb.org/blogs/would-10-vat-pay-1000-month-ubi&quot;&gt;would be insufficient&lt;/a&gt; to fund a $1,000 UBI. I too found that Yang’s plan would add to the deficit, though it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;dramatically reduce poverty and inequality&lt;/a&gt;. I also simulated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/a-revenue-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d7d517dbeeea&quot;&gt;budget-neutral version&lt;/a&gt; of the plan (closer to $500 per month), which would still be distributionally progressive, and found that the citizenship limitation is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/why-some-low-income-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-c95d0f1cc433&quot;&gt;main reason&lt;/a&gt; some low-income people are left worse off. Pomerleau found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://taxfoundation.org/andrew-yang-value-added-tax&quot;&gt;raising the VAT to 22 percent and reducing the amount to $750&lt;/a&gt; would make it budget-neutral. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubicalculator.com/&quot;&gt;UBI Calculator&lt;/a&gt; was released, showing that Yang’s plan would add to the deficit but benefit most citizens, especially low-income ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katz and Sarel simulated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://euiha41fnsb2lyeld3vkc37i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Basic-Income-in-Israel.pdf&quot;&gt;UBI in Israel&lt;/a&gt; funded by (a) higher income taxes and (b) ending welfare programs and tax benefits. Their plan provided monthly amounts between $340 and $930 per adult, with amount rising with age, and between $40 and $190 per child, depending on the child’s birth number in the family. They found that this plan would reduce inequality and improve work incentives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-01-01-what-we-learned-about-basic-income-in-2019-1.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lansley and Reed modeled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.compassonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Compass_BasicIncomeForAll_2019.pdf&quot;&gt;two versions of a UBI for the UK&lt;/a&gt;: one funded by tax and benefit changes, and the other funded by a social wealth fund. They find that “a basic income even at modest levels would be highly progressive, reduce poverty and inequality, and cut dependency on means testing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-01-01-what-we-learned-about-basic-income-in-2019-2.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plá et al found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.euromod.ac.uk/sites/default/files/working-papers/em8-19.pdf&quot;&gt;replacing Spain’s existing benefit system&lt;/a&gt; with a budget-neutral UBI would be modestly regressive, and Gentilini and Rigolini &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/103921528839429277/SSN-Day8-1pm-Ugo-UBI.pdf&quot;&gt;found the same&lt;/a&gt; with respect to Russia and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colombino reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;https://wol.iza.org/articles/is-unconditional-basic-income-viable-alternative-to-other-social-welfare-measures/long&quot;&gt;10 simulation studies&lt;/a&gt; of UBI and negative income taxes (NITs) from multiple countries (as well as 11 non-simulation studies), finding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the evaluation criterion goes beyond labor supply effects (e.g. takes into account the effects on inequality and on the values of non-market activities), NIT and UBI in most cases turn out to be superior to the current systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;child-allowance-simulations&quot;&gt;Child allowance simulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Child allowances are UBIs for children; they exist in some form in many countries, and the US has considered reforms to create one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most significant US child assistance proposal is the American Family Act (AFA), which would reform the Child Tax Credit to eliminate the phase-in and increase the amount. This would create a near-child allowance, excluding only high earners. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2019/3/5/the-afa-and-child-poverty&quot;&gt;Collyer et al&lt;/a&gt; found “that the AFA would move 4 million children out of poverty and cut deep poverty among children in half,” with the phase-in removal being particularly important for poverty reduction. Hammond and Orr arrive at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.expandthechildtaxcredit.com/the-american-family-act&quot;&gt;similar conclusion&lt;/a&gt;, while also finding that the AFA would reduce adult poverty by 10 percent and that its average benefit would be higher for non-white families.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wunder found that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00213624.2019.1603769&quot;&gt;$9,330 annual child allowance&lt;/a&gt; would reduce US child poverty by 75 percent, and CANCEA found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubiworks.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Economic-Contribution-of-the-Canada-Child-Benefit.pdf&quot;&gt;Canada would have 588,000 more children in poverty&lt;/a&gt; if not for their Child Benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;carbon-dividend-simulations&quot;&gt;Carbon dividend simulations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon dividends are carbon fees whose revenue is distributed as an unconditional cash transfer, i.e. as a (small) UBI. Several carbon pricing bills are in the US Congress, but only one fully rebates the revenue as a UBI: the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICDA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kaufman et al found that the EICDA would reduce emissions and air pollution, and also would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/research/report/assessment-energy-innovation-and-carbon-dividend-act&quot;&gt;highly progressive&lt;/a&gt;. Hafstead found that the EICDA would be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rff.org/cpc/&quot;&gt;net financial gain&lt;/a&gt; for the bottom three quintiles (on average) and reduce annual emissions by 53 percent by 2035, though it would also reduce GDP by 2.5 percent by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2020-01-01-what-we-learned-about-basic-income-in-2019-3.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;related-programs&quot;&gt;Related programs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;givedirectly-cash-transfers&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly cash transfers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://givedirectly.org&quot;&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; is a charity that provides unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) to extremely poor families, mostly in East Africa. They were founded by economists and continue to study the effect of their work in randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their most newsworthy paper, released in December, examined the general equilibrium effects of their transfers. In this experiment, entire villages were treated, with transfers restricted to low-income households. Egger et al found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/88/GE-Paper_2019-12-18.pdf&quot;&gt;non-recipients also benefited&lt;/a&gt;: households receiving the transfers saw consumption rise, but so did households in the same village who didn’t get the money — and their consumption rose a similar amount. Each dollar of cash transfers grew the local economy by $2.60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other studies also found substantial benefits from the GiveDirectly UCTs. Haushofer et al found that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Ringdal_Shapiro_Wang_IPV_2019-07-13_jh.pdf&quot;&gt;UCTs reduce intimate partner violence&lt;/a&gt;, with larger benefits when given to women; like Egger, they find spillovers, with violence toward non-recipient women in treated villages falling nearly as much as for recipient women. In another paper, Haushofer et al found that UCTs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.princeton.edu/~joha/publications/Haushofer_Reisinger_Shapiro_Inequality_2019.pdf&quot;&gt;worsen psychological well-being for non-recipients&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Cooke et al find &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cash_Crop_Ugandan_CoffeeRCT.pdf&quot;&gt;significant increases in consumption and revenue&lt;/a&gt; for coffee farmer recipients of GiveDirectly UCTs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GiveDirectly will release results from their universal basic income experiment next year; the 2019 Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee is researching it. They also published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.givedirectly.org/basic-income/&quot;&gt;guide to UBI&lt;/a&gt; this year, which includes relevant academic research and their planned contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;other-cash-transfers&quot;&gt;Other cash transfers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carneiro et al found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~uctpimr/research/CDGP.pdf&quot;&gt;providing extremely poor Nigerian families UCTs&lt;/a&gt; from pregnancy until the child turned 2, combined with pre- and neo-natal information, reduced children’s stunting by 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tracing Mexican families 20 years after their receipt of a conditional cash transfer (CCT), Aguilar et al found &lt;a href=&quot;http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/423621568052375850/pdf/Long-Term-Effects-of-PROSPERA-on-Welfare.pdf&quot;&gt;positive effects&lt;/a&gt; on household formation, migration, durable assets, consumption expenditures and food security, and intergenerational mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baird et al evaluated a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gps.ucsd.edu/_files/faculty/mcintosh/mcintosh_research_when-the-money-runs-out.pdf&quot;&gt;two-year CCT-UCT experiment&lt;/a&gt; for adolescent females in Malawi, finding that the CCT caused sustained improvements on education and fertility (having children when they want to). While the UCT did not cause sustained benefits among recipients, it improved fertility and reduced HIV infections in the short term, and improved health of the recipients’ children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daidone et al reviewed evaluations of &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ajae/article/101/5/1401/5420281&quot;&gt;government cash transfer programs in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;, which show consistently positive effects on consumption and moving workers from casual agricultural wage labor to more productive work on family farms or elsewhere, though other effects varied by country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;universality-and-unconditionality&quot;&gt;Universality and unconditionality&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New research compares the traditional means testing and requirements to the universality and unconditionality of UBI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kidd and Athias examined &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.developmentpathways.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Hit-and-Miss-March13-1.pdf&quot;&gt;38 programs across 23 low- and middle-income countries&lt;/a&gt;, finding that the four universal programs were significantly more effective at reaching the poor than means-tested programs, mistakenly excluding under 10 percent of its intended audience, compared to exclusion errors above 50 percent in most means-tested programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ILO and UNICEF published a report &lt;a href=&quot;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/wcms_669336.pdf&quot;&gt;advocating universal child grants&lt;/a&gt; across countries as a tool of meeting the UN’s goal of ending global poverty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuert et al reviewed the behavioral economics literature in their paper, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ideas42-Work-Requirements-Paper.pdf&quot;&gt;Work Requirements Don’t Work&lt;/a&gt;. Harris studied the &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/297/&quot;&gt;US SNAP program&lt;/a&gt; (food stamps) specifically, finding that “work requirements significantly decreased SNAP participation and marginally increased employment for ABAWD [Able-Bodied Adults without Dependents].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sentiment&quot;&gt;Sentiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the US, a Hill-HarrisX poll found &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/463055-more-voters-support-universal-basic-income&quot;&gt;rising support&lt;/a&gt; for a $1,000 per month UBI to help Americans whose jobs are threatened by automation, from 43 percent in February to 49 percent in September; it is especially popular with voters under age 35 and Democrats. Echelon Insights &lt;a href=&quot;http://echeloninsights.com/wp-content/uploads/Omnibus-June-2019_Policies.pdf&quot;&gt;asked voters&lt;/a&gt; about UBI without the automation framing, emphasizing its unconditionality, and found that 40 percent supported it; they too found higher support among Democrats and young people, as well as those with lower incomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Alan Krueger conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/evidence-base/what-do-americans-think-about-universal-basic-income/&quot;&gt;survey experiment&lt;/a&gt;, asking Americans whether they support (a) a UBI in the US, and (b) a UBI in poor parts of Africa, randomizing the order of (a) and (b). Respondents who were asked first about UBI in Africa were more favorable to UBI in the US, and those who were asked first about UBI in the US were less favorable to UBI in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stadelmann-Steffen and Dermont identified &lt;a href=&quot;https://boris.unibe.ch/135192/1/JSP-StadelmannSteffenDermont2019.pdf&quot;&gt;greater UBI support in Finland&lt;/a&gt; than in Switzerland, with people in both countries favoring UBIs that are (a) more generous, and (b) restricted to citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminiscently of both Krueger’s survey experiment and Mahdavi’s PFD paper, Mosec and Mo conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/133270/filename/133484.pdf&quot;&gt;survey experiment in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, finding that cash transfers increase support for political leaders and institutions only when they are primed to think of inequality (salience of inequality also reduces political support among those denied cash transfers). Similarly, Zucco et al conducted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2019.1577388&quot;&gt;survey experiments in Brazil and Turkey&lt;/a&gt; finding that “conditional transfers are only marginally more popular than similar unconditional transfers in nationally representative samples, but that this difference is substantially larger among the better-off and among those primed to think of themselves as different from beneficiaries.” Finally, Rios et al &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/disa.12378&quot;&gt;also show&lt;/a&gt; that “residents of Fiji who received a post‐disaster cash transfer are up to 20 per cent more likely to be very satisfied with the government than are those who did not.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some common threads from UBI research in 2019? New evidence from Alaska, Finland, and developing countries find that UBIs and cash transfers have generally similar effects: positive effects on consumption and children’s health, and on incomes in developing countries. UCTs in Kenya had positive economic spillovers but negative psychological spillovers, which may also be evident in Pakistan. Simulated UBIs were regressive when only replacing means-tested programs, but progressive when other funding sources were included, and various studies found that universal transfers can better reach the poor. Finally, UBI appears to be getting more popular, though its reception varies by country and framing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important evidence on UBI in 2020 may come from GiveDirectly’s UBI experiment in Kenya, which is randomized by village and guarantees recipients transfers for up to 12 years. But if it’s anything like 2019, we’ll have much more research to look forward to, as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/why-some-lowincome-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend">&lt;h4 id=&quot;theyre-mostly-non-citizens&quot;&gt;They’re mostly non-citizens&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend showed that the plan is progressive: for example, the disposable income of the bottom decile more than doubles, while it falls by 4 percent for the top decile. While the static analysis pegged the deficit impact at $1.4 trillion per year, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/a-revenue-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d7d517dbeeea?postPublishedType=initial&quot;&gt;revenue-neutral version&lt;/a&gt; would also be highly progressive, reducing poverty and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But statistics like that are averages across tens of millions of people. Another visualization (below) showed that 10 to 15 percent of people in low income households come out behind. Households with income below $10,000 appear especially likely to be worse off. Why is this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-28-why-some-lowincome-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-0.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-people-come-outbehind&quot;&gt;Why people come out behind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Households left worse off by the Yang plan fall into two buckets: those who get the UBI, and those who don’t. Any household that doesn’t get the UBI is left worse off, since they’ll only pay taxes. Some households that get the UBI still come out behind if their taxes exceed the UBI (less benefits they might give up).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would households not get the UBI? There are three sub-buckets here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Households (tax filing units) with no adults.&lt;/strong&gt;The UBI is only given to adults. 1.6 million people are in zero-adult tax filing units (4 percent of all who come out behind).*&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Households with no adult citizens.&lt;/strong&gt;The UBI is only given to adult citizens. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-by-citizenship-status/&quot;&gt;7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans are non-citizens, and 23 million people are in households that have adults but no adult citizens (51 percent of all who come out behind).**&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Households that decline the UBI to keep their current benefits.&lt;/strong&gt;Yang has said that households could keep their current benefits if they want to. I assume that households maximize the value of their benefits, so if they receive more than $12,000 per adult citizen in annual benefits (SNAP, TANF, SSI, and WIC), they decline the UBI. 2.7 million people are in households that decline the UBI (6 percent of all who come out behind).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These estimates warrant a couple wonky caveats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Households” are actually tax filing units in this analysis. The dataset is the Open Source Policy Center’s version of the Current Population Survey, postprocessed in the Tax-Data project to create tax units suitable for tax analysis. This improves modeling of the Yang plan, given its revenue measures relating to the personal income tax code, namely raising the payroll tax cap and treating capital gains as ordinary income. The Current Population Survey itself shows that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PSLmodels/taxdata/issues/321&quot;&gt;under 25,000 people&lt;/a&gt; are in zero-adult households, indicating that nearly all of the 1.6 million people in zero-adult tax units are children who file taxes separately from their parents. Many of these would therefore still benefit from the Freedom Dividend.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The dataset powering this analysis didn’t include citizenship status, so I created citizen and non-citizen “copies” of each household, assigning each “citizen copy” a weight of 0.93, and each “non-citizen copy” a weight of 0.07. That means that households are not modeled to include citizens and non-citizens. It also means that the Freedom Dividend’s citizenship requirement affects each income group equally, and 7 percent of each income group would come out behind by default. This is, of course, false, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2017/03/07/the-massive-wage-gap-between-u-s-citizens-and-immigrants-infographic/#23c3321c3e65&quot;&gt;citizens out-earn non-citizens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-those-reasons-vary-byincome&quot;&gt;How those reasons vary by income&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, let’s take a look at how the reasons for coming out behind vary by income:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-28-why-some-lowincome-people-come-out-behind-in-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-1.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few insights are evident:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most people in “losing” households with income between $10K and $200K are non-citizens. This might even be underestimated given the correlation between income and citizenship not modeled here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;60% of people in losing households earning under $10K have no adults in their tax filing unit — an artifact of the data that separates children from adults in the same household and may not reflect a true loss.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Higher income households are more likely to come out behind because taxes exceed the UBI.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Benefit clawback hurts a larger share of middle income households than low-income households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more caveat: This is not a counterfactual analysis. That is, this doesn’t show the share of people who would no longer come out behind if a policy lever were changed. Including citizens in the UBI wouldn’t make 7 percent of $500K+ households come out ahead, they’d just move to the “Taxes exceed net UBI” bucket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at lower incomes, the small “Taxes exceed net UBI” share suggests that removing the citizenship requirement would keep a lot of people from losing money. The dark red at the bottom also suggests that including children would keep low-income households from losing out, though that’s a less binary and more expensive policy choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite potential controversy over its benefit clawback provision, the feature of Yang’s plan that puts most low-income people behind is its limitation to adult citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated 2019–07–15 to include more information on zero-adult households (tax filing units). See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UBICenter/ubi-center/issues/70&quot;&gt;this GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; for progress shifting from tax-unit-level analysis to household-level analysis, which will address this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <updated>2019-06-24T17:55:59+00:00</updated>
      <id>/introducing-the-ubi-center</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/introducing-the-ubi-center">&lt;p&gt;Universal basic income has come a long way. The idea of giving every member of society an unconditional cash payment originated centuries ago with thinkers such as Adam Smith and Thomas Paine, but has mostly remained confined to economic theory since. Economists like Milton Friedman imbued UBI with new life in the 1960s and 1970s, and President Nixon nearly implemented a form of it. Governments and nonprofits experimented with cash transfers around the world, and the evidence base grew. Today, these experiments include full UBI studies, candidates for political office are centering their campaigns around UBI, and policymakers are calling for more UBI research and pilots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, important questions remain about what would happen if UBI were implemented. Past experiments and related research give clues into some common concerns, like what people would spend on and how much they’d adjust work hours, and new research will refine these estimates. But these questions and more, like how the economy would respond and whom would be left better or worse off, depend on how UBI policies are designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBI is a policy tool, and like any tool, it can be used to promote a range of objectives. Some may see it as a way to cut poverty and inequality, or streamline bureaucracy and improve incentives in existing programs, or insure against economic volatility from potential technological change, or grow the economy. Others may doubt UBI’s ability to achieve these results, and others still may worry it could backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These claims cannot be evaluated in the abstract. The notion of UBI doesn’t reduce poverty; only specific UBI policy does that. A UBI funded by a carbon tax would reduce poverty, but a UBI funded solely by ending means-tested programs would increase it. Similarly, UBI can have different effects on economic growth, depending on the design of the policy and the macroeconomic assumptions used to study the policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I formed the UBI Center to evaluate these claims concretely. The UBI Center will analyze UBI policies that have been proposed by others, produce UBI policies, and compare these to other economic policies. And since science is better when it’s transparent, the UBI Center will publish all the code behind each analysis to make results fully reproducible (to my knowledge, this makes the UBI Center the first open source think tank).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you share my belief that UBI is a powerful idea worthy of serious economic analysis, I invite you to explore the research and follow our journey. The UBI Center is launching with an analysis of two UBI policies: &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/a-revenue-neutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d7d517dbeeea?postPublishedType=initial&quot;&gt;revenue-neutral version&lt;/a&gt; of the Freedom Dividend.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:affiliation&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:affiliation&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These policies are analyzed in a two-part post and in &lt;a href=&quot;http://plans.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;Plan Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you interactively explore the effect on various household profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UBI Center’s mission is to produce open-source research to inform a robust debate around UBI policies. While I’m the only one currently working on this mission full-time, others have been critical in getting to this stage. From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ospc.org&quot;&gt;Open Source Policy Center&lt;/a&gt; building the models that underlie UBI analyses, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://usbig.net&quot;&gt;USBIG&lt;/a&gt; leaders sharing their expertise in the UBI space, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ajsmart.com&quot;&gt;AJ&amp;amp;Smart&lt;/a&gt; generously design-sprinting toward credible economic research, this is a product of collaboration. If you’d like to contribute, please get in touch at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:max@ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;max@ubicenter.org&lt;/a&gt;; you can also support our work with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://donorbox.org/ubicenter&quot;&gt;donation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="/budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A budget-neutral version of Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend" />

      <updated>2019-06-24T17:49:26+00:00</updated>
      <id>/budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/ubicenter/distributional-analysis-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-d8dab818bf1b&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this two-part series analyzing Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend showed that the universal basic income policy would reduce poverty and inequality, while adding $1.4 trillion to the annual deficit. Using the same approach and assumptions (no labor market or macroeconomic effects), I find that a budget-neutral plan would provide each adult citizen $471 per month, rather than the $1,000 proposed by Yang. These payments would be offset by Yang’s funding sources: increases on existing taxes, addition of new taxes, and partial replacement of assistance programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the original Freedom Dividend, this budget-neutral plan would reduce poverty and inequality, and benefit most Americans. However, each of these effects would be muted, and a larger share of middle-income households would come out behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in Part 1, I modeled the plan with the open-source Tax-Calculator software and its version of the Current Population Survey. Code and documentation for the analysis are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/UBICenter/ubi-center/tree/master/notebooks/yang&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;modeling-a-budget-neutral-freedomdividend&quot;&gt;Modeling a budget-neutral Freedom Dividend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Freedom Dividend is a set of seven policies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$1,000 per month to every adult citizen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rescinding of benefits for households who opt for the basic income (they can keep their current benefits if they want); the Freedom Dividend does not replace Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment insurance, or housing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 10 percent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yang2020.com/policies/value-added-tax/&quot;&gt;value added tax&lt;/a&gt; (VAT, a form of consumption tax common across Europe)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A 0.1 percent, $50 billion per year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yang2020.com/policies/financial-transaction-tax/&quot;&gt;financial transaction tax&lt;/a&gt; (FTT)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A $20 per ton &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yang2020.com/policies/carbon-fee-dividend/&quot;&gt;carbon tax&lt;/a&gt; (Yang also proposes an additional $20 per ton carbon tax to fund clean energy investments, which is not modeled here)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lifting the cap on Social Security contributions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Treating capital gains as ordinary income&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the approach outlined in Part 1, I assume households decline the UBI if the combined value of their current benefits exceeds the UBI; estimate the incidence of carbon taxes, VAT, and FTT using analyses from the Tax Policy Center and the Treasury Department; and calculate the effect of the payroll and capital gains tax reforms with Tax-Calculator. I also assume that workers don’t respond to the new income or changing tax rates; see Part 1 for a discussion on potential macroeconomic effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gross cost of a $1,000 UBI for adult citizens is $2.8 trillion, and after new taxes and benefit savings, the total deficit impact is $1.4 trillion per year (about 160% of the current deficit). Government saves $151 billion from households giving up benefits or declining the UBI to keep current benefits, and the remaining $1.2 trillion comes from tax reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-24-budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-0.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varying the UBI amount shows that these funding measures with a $0 UBI would reduce the annual budget deficit by $1.2 trillion. The UBI amount that produces a $0 deficit impact is $471 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-24-budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-1.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gross cost of giving each adult citizen $478 per month is $1.3 trillion. $128 billion is saved from households declining the UBI or current benefits, and the remaining $1.17 trillion is from new taxes (tax revenue falls slightly because I assume consumption of goods and services that generate carbon tax revenue rises with the UBI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-24-budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-2.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-the-revenue-sourceswork&quot;&gt;How the revenue sources work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the original Freedom Dividend, 57 percent of the benefits savings came from SNAP (food stamps), and this share increases to 70 percent with the budget-neutral version. This follows from SNAP’s relatively wide reach and low monthly amount. For example, TANF and SSI have higher monthly amounts, and the share of dollars for these plans given up for UBI falls from more than half with the $1,000 per month plan to about 30 percent at $471 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-24-budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-3.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tax side is almost identical to the original Freedom Dividend, since the lower amount affects only the carbon tax. New taxes cost each decile an average of 8 percent of income, except the top decile which is cost 12 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-24-budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-4.jpg#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-budget-neutral-freedom-dividend-would-be-progressively-redistributive&quot;&gt;A budget-neutral Freedom Dividend would be progressively redistributive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average household in the bottom 80 percent would see disposable incomes rise by about $3,000 per year, while the average household in the top 10 percent would lose about $21,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-24-budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-5.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a share of disposable income, those numbers are progressive at every decile, raising the bottom decile 47 percent and lowering the top decile by 9 percent (compared to +119 percent and -4 percent in the $1,000 plan).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2019-06-24-budgetneutral-version-of-andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-6.png#layoutTextWidth&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various measures of poverty and inequality would fall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poverty falls 35 percent&lt;/strong&gt;, as defined by the share of people in households with disposable income below the federal poverty guideline.
  Not an official poverty measure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Gini index (a measure of general inequality) falls 9 percent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The top 1 percent’s share of income falls 17 percent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The top 0.1 percent’s share of income falls 21 percent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These inequality measures reflect how the plan compresses the income distribution at both top and bottom: the budget-neutral Freedom Dividend raises the 10th income percentile by 17 percent, raises median income by 6 percent, and reduces the 90th percentile by 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;most-come-out-ahead-many-come-outbehind&quot;&gt;Most come out ahead, many come out behind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the budget-neutral Freedom Dividend is progressive on a net basis and the bottom 8 deciles benefit on average, the new taxes outweigh the UBI for many households. Two thirds of Americans would benefit, including 46 percent who would see disposable incomes rise more than 5 percent; the third who come out behind includes 18 percent who lose more than 5 percent. While these net contributors are concentrated among households with income of $200,000 or more, about 20 percent of households with income under $75,000 also come out behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High income households primarily come out behind because their tax liability would rise considerably, especially payroll and capital gains taxes. For example, using the UBI Center &lt;a href=&quot;http://plans.ubicenter.org&quot;&gt;Plan Explorer&lt;/a&gt;, we can filter to one-adult households with income above $500,000, who would pay an average of $11,411 more in taxes each month. All households in this category would lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low income households primarily come out behind because they forego benefits to get the UBI, or vice versa, and only pay new taxes like VAT. For example, one-adult households with income below $25,000 gain an average of $251 per month on net, while 8 percent come out behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further filtering these to households that receive benefits, the net effect is +$97 per month and 21 percent see incomes fall. This subset includes 12 million people, 40 percent of all one-adult households with income below $25,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;major-policy-tends-toward-disruption&quot;&gt;Major policy tends toward disruption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend and its budget-neutral adaptation analyzed here would likely have a greater impact on poverty and inequality than any seriously discussed policy in recent U.S. history. For some, this egalitarian result would be worth major economic costs, including to their own pocketbook; others will oppose it for concern over the macro economy or their personal finances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though: it’s hard to design major policy without disruption. If society determines how this disruption stacks up against other outcomes of interest (poverty, inequality, work incentives, economic growth), policymakers can design plans accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But can we have our cake and eat it, too? That’s the question the UBI Center intends to answer in developing UBI plans that balance disruption against other measurable outcomes. Optimizing for the deficit is just the start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">Part 1 of this two-part series analyzing Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend showed that the universal basic income policy would reduce poverty and inequality, while adding $1.4 trillion to the annual deficit. Using the same approach and assumptions (no labor market or macroeconomic effects), I find that a budget-neutral plan would provide each adult citizen $471 per month, rather than the $1,000 proposed by Yang. These payments would be offset by Yang’s funding sources: increases on existing taxes, addition of new taxes, and partial replacement of assistance programs.</summary>
