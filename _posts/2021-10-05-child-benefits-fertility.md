Next Friday, families will receive the fourth [monthly Child Tax Credit payment](https://www.ubicenter.org/advance-ctc), created as part of the American Rescue Plan.
As Democrats seek to make that policy permanent in their upcoming reconciliation package, and Senator Joe Manchin suggests adding work or education requirements to the tax credit, the idea of cash assistance for families has returned to the news.

We and other researchers have studied child allowances extensively, finding that they reduce poverty [nationwide and across states](https://www.ubicenter.org/child-allowance-state-simulation), and are often [more cost-effective antipoverty interventions](https://www.ubicenter.org/child-ubi-share) than cash assistance to adults.
These poverty reductions in turn [improve outcomes](https://child-allowance.ubicenter.org/empirical) ranging from education to health to earnings.
As we discussed in our analysis of Senator Mitt Romney's [Family Security Act](ubicenter.org/family-security-act), the new Child Tax Credit probably would reduce parental labor supply modestly, enabling parents to [spend more time with their children](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/55041/1/684016389.pdf).
But work requirements designed to bring parents back to work [generally don't work](https://www.ideas42.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ideas42-Work-Requirements-Paper.pdf), and the Jain Family Institute has found that they would cut the Child Tax Credit's poverty impact [by a factor of five](https://twitter.com/jainfamilyinst/status/1438895355412811784).

Many discussions of cash benefits for families also turn to population: how does giving parents money affect the number of children that are born?
And how would such effects translate to the economy and other aspects of society?
In this article, we describe the reasons for falling fertility in the US, the evidence that child benefits can reverse that trend, and the economic benefits (and minimal environmental concern) such growth would provide.

# Fertility in the United States

Researchers measure children born as the *fertility rate*, or the number of children per woman.[^birthrate]
As of 2020, the fertility rate was 1.77 in the United States and 2.44 globally.
Global fertility has fallen consistently over time, and US fertility recently peaked at 3.60 in 1957 before falling roughly to its current value by 1980.

[^birthrate]: The birth rate, births per 1,000 population, is an alternative to the fertility rate.
[US birth rates](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/birth-rate-the-number-of-births-per-1000-people-in-the-population?country=USA+%28whites%29~USA+%28blacks%29) are available separately for White and Black people, dating to the early 1900s.
This measure has also declined over time, other than a rise from about 1940 to 1960.

To maintain the current population level, the fertility rate must be at least 2: one for each parent.
This is called the *replacement rate*, and in practice it exceeds 2 due to child mortality:
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates it to be [2.1 in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr012-508.pdf).
US fertility has been below 2.1 since 1971.

Why has fertility fallen?
Max Roser of Our World In Data presents trends and evidence from around the world on this question, claiming that:
>Particularly important are 1) the empowerment of women in society and in relationships – through education, labor force participation, and strengthened women’s rights – and 2) the increased well-being and status of children.

[Roser's article](https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate) includes many of the charts that we use in this article (we filter them to the US).

## Women's education

In 1950, American women aged 15 to 49 had an average of 9.3 years of schooling, and the fertility rate was 3.1.
By 2010, education attainment had risen to 13.3 years, and US fertility had fallen to 2.0.

This pattern is consistent across countries, and empirical research finds that the relationship goes beyond correlation.
A [randomized controlled trial in Kenya](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20121607) found that educational subsidies reduced fertility, and other analyses of natural experiments from [primary school extension](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/62482/1/722415397.pdf), [school construction](http://www.nber.org/papers/w10513), and [universal primary education](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387807000855) also find that women's educational attainment lowers fertility.

# Can child allowances boost fertility?

Standard economic theory suggests that child allowances would increase fertility (children born per woman), since they reduce the cost of childbearing: given a level of demand, price reductions increase supply.
In a [review for the Institute for Family Studies](https://ifstudies.org/blog/pro-natal-policies-work-but-they-come-with-a-hefty-price-tag), Lyman Stone compiled a [list of 65 studies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rG74z2tUWm2NAsDCvq87UIgjqFI7lU9iQWwNfh3_0iY/edit) that estimate the magnitude of this effect in the real world.
These span countries, program designs, generosity, and evaluation methods, but share the goal of quantifying the extent to which parents respond to changes in the price of raising a child.

The vast majority of studies find sort of effect that pro-natal policy had on child-rearing.
As Stone notes, “An increase in the present value of child benefits equal to 10% of a household’s income can be expected to produce between 0.5% and 4.1% higher birth rates,” with an average elasticity of 0.25.
To understand elasticity, take a look at one of the studies in the spreadsheet: “[Economic Incentives Surrounding Fertility: Evidence from Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend Fund](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26712),” a paper analyzing the fertility effects of Alaska’s 1982 social health fund.
The paper has a median elasticity of 0.20, which means that benefits in the program equal to 10% of a household’s income can be expected to produce 2.0% higher birth rates.
Though the long-term fertility effects are smaller than the short-term ones in general, there’s still reliable evidence that more children are born as a result of cash redistribution toward families.

Overall, Stone [...].
Researchers at Statistics Norway arrived at a [similar conclusion](https://ssb.brage.unit.no/ssb-xmlui/handle/11250/2652050), finding in a review of 57 studies that "Childcare and universal transfers seem to have the most positive effects on fertility."

In a [separate report on the American Family Act](https://ifstudies.org/blog/cash-for-kids-assessing-the-american-family-act)---the Child Tax Credit expansion legislation that the American Rescue Plan effectively adopted---Stone summarizes 

Furthermore, the gap between the number of children women want to have and the number they are expected to have is large and widening.
The average number of children women say they want to have (2.7) is [50% higher](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/upshot/american-fertility-is-falling-short-of-what-women-want.html) than the average number of children women actually have.[^men-desired-fertility]

[^men-desired-fertility]: Per the New York Times article: "From 1972 to 2016, men have expressed almost exactly the same ideal fertility rates as women: In a given year, they average just 0.04 children below what women say is ideal."

Moreover, young adults with fewer kids than they’d like generally point to financial issues.
[Seven of the top eight](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/upshot/americans-are-having-fewer-babies-they-told-us-why.html) reasons cited by millennials as to why they have fewer children than they’d like is economic in nature.
Nearly half say that their worries about the economy in general disincentivize them from having more children, and 64% point to the high price of child care as a reason why.

These arguments are not without detractors.
Right-wing policy analyst for the American Enterprise Institute Scott Winship has argued that economic factors play [only a small role](https://twitter.com/swinshi/status/1196070223075565568) in declining fertility, with fewer unwanted births playing a larger factor.
For example, an estimated [64%](https://www3.nd.edu/~kbuckles/BGS_june2020.pdf) of the decrease in fertility can be traced to decreasing unintended births.
Though this may be true, it still doesn’t undermine the broader point that economic precarity can sink fertility.

# What about climate change?

A first-order effect of larger populations is greater carbon emissions from higher consumption levels.
However, the evolving policy landscape and the connection between youth and environmentalism dramatically shrink this first order effect, and suggest that higher fertility could even help us decarbonize.

Researchers at Founders Pledge estimated that, accounting for policies in place to limit carbon emissions, having a child today creates [four metric tons of carbon emissions per year](https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-and-lifestyle-report). Also clean tech, etc.]

Younger people are also more likely to care about climate change.
[In a 2021 poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/05/26/key-findings-how-americans-attitudes-about-climate-change-differ-by-generation-party-and-other-factors/), the Pew Research Center found that Gen Z Americans are about ten percentage points more likely than Baby Boomers to describe climate change as a top priority.
This pattern persists across a range of survey questions, indicating that a younger electorate would support stronger policy to reduce carbon emissions.
Indeed, a [2021 poll from Morning Consult](https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/04/28122000/2104106_crosstabs_MC_ENERGY_PARIS_ACCORD_RVs_v3_LM.pdf) found that Millennials supported a carbon tax as a way to fund infrastructure by 32 points, vs. Boomers who supported it by 16 points.[^morningconsult]

[^morningconsult]: Gen Z supported a carbon tax by 14 points, but Morning Consult only surveyed 150 Gen Zers compared to 498 Millennials and 760 Baby Boomers.

## An aging population

The age dependency ratio - that is, the population share between the ages of 25 and 54 - is an important indicator as to the economic conditions of a country. A high age dependency ratio can endanger economic growth, as it means that tax-payer care for the elderly and children eat up a larger share of every worker’s salary. High age dependency ratios can also cause the economy to stagnate as fewer workers with disposable incomes can mean lower aggregate demand, which in turn, decreases capital investment and hurts growth. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers is a well-known contemporary advocate of the secular stagnation theory, which states that America has suffered from growth that is persistently below-expectations because of below-average demand.

[Researchers at the International Monetary Fund found](https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=3c589850-6c74-422d-a8b5-26caae7eb8b9%40pdc-v-sessmgr01) that, had fertility remained at the (higher) 1960 level, real GDP growth would have stayed constant or risen slightly from 1980 on, rather than declining.




America’s over-a-decade long decrease in fertility rates poses a risk of stagnant economic growth, as current trends point to a significant shrinking of the share of the population in prime labor force ages. Three researchers in 2016 - Nicole Maestras, Kathleen J. Mullen, and David Powell - [tackled the question](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22452/w22452.pdf) of how much aging could affect economic growth. By analyzing economic trends in states during a thirty-year period, they found that a “10% increase in the fraction of the population ages 60+ decreases the growth rate of GDP per capita by 5.5%.” The study projects that population aging will slow annual GDP growth by .6 percentage points in the 2020s. Approximately two-thirds of this decrease was attributed to lower worker productivity, while the remaining third was the reduction in aggregate hours worked. 

Moreover, the federal government spends around [six times as much](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/2048-only-6-budget-will-go-children) on the elderly population as they do on children, indicating that a lagging fertility rate could have a larger than expected negative effect on workers’ incomes.

# Conclusion

Evidence is early, but other countries have started to reverse the fertility decline as they've become highly developed.
Generous child benefits could be part of this trend (TODO: check child benefits for reversed countries), and we can follow suit.

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-vs-human-development-index?time=1990..2014&country=~USA" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

Population decline is a long-term threat to economic prosperity.
America’s aging population is expected to hamper economic growth in the near-future.
Social spending specifically aimed at new parents can slow down and even reverse these trends.
These benefits would be enjoyed by more than just the parents and children, but would improve the economic prospects of the U.S.
