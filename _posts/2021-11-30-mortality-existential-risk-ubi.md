Below is a chapter I wrote for the book [Death And Anti-Death, Volume 18: Fifty Years After Earth Day](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Anti-Death-18-Fifty-University/dp/1934297348), published in December 2020.
In it, I argue that poverty alleviation would reduce both mortality and existential risk, and that, among anti-poverty programs, universal basic income has a number of advantages over targeted and in-kind benefits.
I'm posting it on Giving Tuesday both to highlight the work of GiveDirectly, which provides cash transfers to extremely poor people and conducts research on those payments that I cite extensively, and to invite readers to consider tax and benefit policy as a cause area for effective giving.
(_Disclaimer: I founded and currently lead two nonprofits in this space: the [UBI Center](https://ubicenter.org/donate), which researches universal basic income policies, and [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org), which builds technology to empower people to understand and change public policy._)

Beyond the information in this chapter, I believe trends in the past year indicate that tax and benefit policy is a promising cause area.
[GiveWell has said](https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers) that "Cash transfers have the strongest track record we've seen for a non-health intervention," yet governments continue to restrict uses of benefit dollars.
The US Bipartisan Infrastructure Package, for example, created a \$14 billion broadband subsidy, and the Build Back Better Act would spend \$500 billion on childcare subsidies (double the amount that it would spend on the Child Tax Credit).
Both of these programs create _welfare cliffs_, in which higher earnings can leave people worse off due to lost benefits.
Developing countries enact policies that are similarly flawed, if not worse.

Last week, GiveWell [revealed](https://blog.givewell.org/2021/11/22/we-aim-to-cost-effectively-direct-around-1-billion-annually-by-2025/) that they're unlikely to find opportunities more than five to eight times more cost-effective than cash transfers.
In their [response](https://www.givedirectly.org/dont-wait/), GiveDirectly claimed that cash transfers are more effective than GiveWell estimates, suggesting that GiveWell will have difficulty finding opportunities even at the 5-8x multiple range.
And in their [previous blog post](https://www.givedirectly.org/1-million-households/), GiveDirectly said that, despite having sent cash transfers to a million households, they've reached under one percent of extremely poor households in Kenya, the country where they have the largest presence.

GiveDirectly continues to be exceptionally worthy, but governments too have a role to play.
The scale of reforming tax and benefit policy is enormous: OECD countries collect a third of GDP in taxes, and redistribute a third of that as cash benefits--and those shares are growing as economies get richer.
We believe we're targeting neglected angles on the broad cause area (technology and considering taxes and benefits together), and our early traction with policymakers in the UK suggests that these novel angles can make reform tractable as well.

With that, here is **Mortality, existential risk, and universal basic income**:
